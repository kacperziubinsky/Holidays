# Holidays App

I created an app for checking the price of holiday offers from TUI. I found the API for this company and created a simple app for checking prices regularly. All of the updates were saved to the database. This project is a good opportunity for me; I really want to learn NODE.JS and React.

## Features

- Cron updates every 45 minutes.
- Save price data to the database
- Save update logs to the database
- Responsive website
